# Simple Tank Drainage System Model
 A physics based, mathematical model of a simple tank drainage system which predicts the time it takes to drain the tank, both with a regular circular pipe outlet with no attachements, and that same pipe with a t-joint attached. 

## Purpose
Done as part of the term project for SYDE 383: Fluid Mechanics at the University of Waterloo

## Physics Concepts Applied
* Toricelli's Law
* Bernoulli's Equation
* Darcy-Weisbach Friction Factor from Colebrook-White Equation
* Continuity Equation
* Head losses due to friction, geometry, and other minor losses
* Hazen-Williams Equation for conceptual understanding
